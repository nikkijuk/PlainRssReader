# PlainRssReader

PlainRssReader is very very simple implementation which reads rss files, 
converts them to json using web api and allows browsing thru simple list

# Background

Implementation has been created as part of Coursera Android Proramming moocs Capstone Project

https://www.coursera.org/learn/aadcapstone/home/welcome

# Requirements 

Requirements for projects are 

- Interact with at least one remotely-hosted web service over the network via HTTP.
- Allow users to navigate between at least two different user interface screens at runtime, 

Example given was 

a hypothetical RSS/Atom reader app might have multiple screens, such as

* a ListView showing all RSS Feed Stories,
* a detail View showing a single Feed Story, and
* a Settings view for configuring information about the Appâ€™s settings.

Current implementation doesn't cover settings, but support will be added later
